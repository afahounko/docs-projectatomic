=== Rollback

==== Using the atomic command

To switch back to the other downloaded tree on your system, use
`atomic host rollback`. This command is particularly useful when there is a
problem after upgrade (for example the new packages break a service
that youâ€™ve configured) because it lets you quickly switch back to the
previous state.
....
$ atomic host rollback
....

You can use the -r option to initiate a reboot immediately:
....
$ atomic host rollback -r
....


==== Using rpm-ostree

If you want to rollback to a previous tree using the `rpm-ostree` command. You
can invoke:
....
$ rpm-ostree rollback
....

You can also add `--reboot` argument to initiate a reboot immediately.
....
$ rpm-ostree rollback --reboot
....
