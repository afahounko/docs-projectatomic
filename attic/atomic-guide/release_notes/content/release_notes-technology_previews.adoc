Identity Management (IdM) in a container is provided as a Technology Preview. To install this new image, use the `atomic install --hostname <IPA_server_hostname> rhel7/ipa-server` command. In addition to `--hostname`, The `atomic install` command supports the following keywords for specifying the style of the container to be run:

** `net-host` - share the host's network to the container
** `publish` - publish all ports to the host's interfaces
** `cap-add` - add a capability to the container

You can also use the  `atomic install rhel7/ipa-server help` command to list these keywords and their usage.

* *overlay2 storage driver now available*
+
// https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1369237
+
The `overlay2` graph driver, along with `overlay`, uses OverlayFS, a copy-on-write union file system that features page-cache sharing between containers. However, `overlay2` is the more performant option. Currently, the driver requires SELinux to be disabled in docker. `overlay2` is available for docker as a Technology Preview feature.
+
To enable the driver, specify *overlay2* in the _/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup_ file:
+
....
STORAGE_DRIVER=overlay2
....
