Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host should be compatible with most hardware in systems that were factory built within the last two years. Hardware compatibility is a particularly important concern if you have an older or custom-built system. Because hardware specifications change almost daily, it is recommended that all systems be checked for compatibility. The most recent list of supported hardware can be found in the https://hardware.redhat.com/[Red Hat Hardware Compatibility List]. Also see https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/rhel-limits[Red Hat Enterprise Linux technology capabilities and limits] for general information about system requirements.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host has the same runtime requirements as Red Hat Enterprise Linux. However, for Anaconda based installations (interactive or Kickstart) and PXE installations on bare metal or in virtual environments, a minimum 2GB of memory is required.
