To enable software updates, you must register your Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host installation.
This is done with the *subscription-manager* command as described below.
If your system is located on a network that requires the use of an HTTP proxy, please see the
Red Hat Knowledge Base Article on https://access.redhat.com/solutions/57669[configuring subscription manager to use an HTTP proxy].
The *--name=* option may be included if you wish to provide an easy to remember name to be used when reviewing subscription records.

....
$ sudo subscription-manager register --username=<username> --auto-attach
....

*Note:* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host works only with Red Hat Subscription Manager (RHSM).
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host does not work with RHN.

*Note:* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host registers two product IDs.
The first is Product ID 271, Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host. The second is Product ID 69, Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server.
They both use the same entitlement.

A properly registered system will display both IDs as is shown below:

....
$ sudo subscription-manager list
