This guide explains how to make your Docker workflow more secure. There
is no one-size-fits-all solution to the problem of
securing a workflow. 

Because there is no single solution for
securing your Docker workflow, you need to understand the tools and
strategies that you can use to improve your Docker workflow's security.
The general strategy for doing this is to reduce the number of potential
attack vectors in your Docker infrastructure available to
malicious agents.

This guide will provide you with the fundamentals you need to understand
the interaction between security practices and the Docker ecosystem.
This guide will furnish you with the tools and
strategies you need to find the security solution that works best with
your Docker workflow.

This is the general strategy for securing containers:
avoid untrusted content, keep containers up-to-date, leverage SELinux,
minimize attack surface, and use virtualization.

The containerization ecosystem is developing, and it changes fast. This
guide is intended to make the containerization ecosystem legible to you
in order to help you make the best choices for your own implementation of
containerization.
