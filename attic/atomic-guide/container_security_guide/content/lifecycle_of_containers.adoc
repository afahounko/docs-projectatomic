This chapter describes the lifecycle of the container. This chapter
describes:

1.  how CVEs are reported for containers
2.  Where to find information about vulnerabilities
3.  how to inspect container runtime settings
4.  how to set up Satellite 6.1 as a private registry
5.  how to federate access.registry.redhat.com
6.  the partner CDK and image-verification process offered by Red Hat
7.  where to find Red Hat Marketplace
8.  how to acquire partner images
9.  how to run images using RHEL Atomic
10.  how Red Hat recommends that you scan Docker images
11.  how OpenStack Enterprise and Atomic Platform consume Docker images from Satellite

*Future Isses That This Section Might cover*

- How CVE's are reported for containers and where to find vulnerability information
- How to inspect container runtime settings - for example make sure users have not put RUN labels to add in security settings (like --spc) that they should not have done.
- How we recommend to setup Satellite 6.1 as a private registry and show how we can federate access.registry.redhat.com 
- The Partner CDK and image verification process we have in place.
- Where to look for the Red Hat Marketplace and how to get hold of our partner images
- How to then run images using RHEL/Atomic and how we would recommend you scan images (daily/weekly/monthly)
- How OSE or Atomic Plaform can consume these images from Satellite (or do we see OSE consuming direct from the internet?)
