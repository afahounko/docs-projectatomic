If you are done using your cluster, you should take it down in a particular way, to make sure it is done neatly. The order is important. If you delete a pod before deleting the replicationController, the pod is restarted. Here is an example:

....
# kubectl delete replicationControllers webserver-controller
# kubectl delete replicationControllers db-controller
# kubectl delete services webserver-service
# kubectl delete services db-service
# kubectl get pods
NAME                                         READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-apiserver-master.example.com            1/1       Running   0          1d
kube-controller-manager-master.example.com   1/1       Running   4          1d
kube-scheduler-master.example.com            1/1       Running   3          1d

....

If you plan to continue using your Kubernetes cluster, run the following on each node to make sure the services are up and running:

....
# for SERVICES in docker kube-proxy.service kubelet.service; do
    systemctl restart $SERVICES
    systemctl status $SERVICES
    done
....

If you are done with the nodes, you can remove them from the master as follows:

....
# kubectl delete node node1.example.com
# kubectl delete node node2.example.com
....
