Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host comes in several different forms. Those forms include:

* A DVD ISO installation image you can use for traditional bare metal or VM installs by launching an installer and selecting options (disk formatting, language, network configuration, user accounts, and so on).
* A variety of cloud and virtualization environment images that you can configure using cloud-init. These cloud images include those made to run on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization, OpenStack, VMware, KVM, AWS, Microsoft Hyper-V and others. 

All images are available from the https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/271/ver=/rhel---7/7.2.4/x86_64/product-software[Download RHEL Atomic Host] page (the ISO images aren't delivered with every version, so you may need to look at earlier versions). To learn about different ways of installing RHEL Atomic Host, the following document describes how to install for different environments using both cloud and traditional ISO images:

Once your Atomic Host system is installed and running, you should enable software updates by registering your Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host system.
This is done with the *subscription-manager* command as described below.
If your system is located on a network that requires the use of an HTTP proxy, please see the
Red Hat Knowledge Base Article on https://access.redhat.com/solutions/57669[configuring subscription manager to use an HTTP proxy].
The *--name=* option may be included if you wish to provide an easy to remember name to be used when reviewing subscription records.

....
$ sudo subscription-manager register --username=<username> --auto-attach
....

*NOTE:* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host works only with Red Hat Subscription Manager (RHSM).
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host does not work with the older RHN subscription model.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host registers two product IDs.
The first is Product ID 271, Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host. The second is Product ID 69, Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server.
They both use the same entitlement. A properly registered system will display both IDs as is shown below:

....
$ sudo subscription-manager list
