Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host should run on any computer or cloud environment that supports 64-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems. The most recent list of supported hardware can be found in the https://hardware.redhat.com/[Red Hat Hardware Compatibility List]. Also see https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/rhel-limits[Red Hat Enterprise Linux technology capabilities and limits] for general information about system requirements. 

Keep in mind that though Atomic Host can run on bare metal, it is particularly suited for running in cloud environments where its size and efficiency as a container run-time environment are particularly useful.
