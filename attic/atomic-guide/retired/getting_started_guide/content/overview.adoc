Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic host is a variation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 optimized to run Linux containers in the Docker format.
It has been modified to be light-weight and efficient, making it a particularly optimal operating system to use as a docker run-time system for cloud environments.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host uses SELinux to provide strong safeguards in multi-tenant environments, and provides the ability to perform
atomic upgrades and rollbacks, enabling quicker and easier maintenance with less downtime. Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host uses the same upstream
projects delivered via the same RPM packaging as Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host is pre-installed with the following tools to support Linux containers:

* docker
* Kubernetes

Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host makes use of the following technologies:

* OSTree and rpm-OSTree - These projects provide atomic upgrades and the ability to roll back upgrades.
* systemd - The powerful new init system for Linux systems that enables faster boot times and easier system orchestration.
* SELinux - Enabled by default to provide complete multi-tenant security. You'll also find Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA), audit and libwrap
available from systemd.

*IMPORTANT*: Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host is not managed in the same way that other Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 variants are managed. Specifically:

* You do not use Yum to upgrade the system.
* There are only two writable directories for local system configuration: /etc/ and /var/. The /usr/ directory is mounted read-only.
Other directories are symlinks to a writable location. For example, the /home/ directory is a symlink to the /var/home/ directory.
* The default partitioning dedicates most of the available space for the containers, using direct LVM instead of the default loopback.
* RHEL Atomic Host provides a choice between **docker** and **docker-latest**, but Red Hat does not support running both **docker** and **docker-latest** on the same machine at the same time.

User and Host specific data should be stored only in the */var/* directory. Only configuration files in the /etc/ directory should be modified.

Preinstalled tools
* RHEL Atomic Host comes with all the tools for running containers preinstalled - docker, kubernetes, etcd, flannel, atomic.
* no man pages
* Atomic has samba SSSD and iSCSI tools preinstalled.
* SELinux is enabled by default.

Live changes capabitilies:
* However, you can layer packages with the `rpm-ostree pkg-add` command. This can be used for live updates as opposed to upgrade or rollback which require reboot.

File system:
* Yum and rpm are only used for reading commands. The file system is a preinstalled, immutable OSTree. Any additional tools such as rsyslog, strace, or tcpdump should be deployed in a container running in privileged mode (`--net=host privileged`).
* RHEL - XFS, RHEL Atomic - ext4
* storage back-end RHEL - loopback, RHEL Atomic - direct-lvm
