As part of Project Atomic's effort to reduce the number of packages that are shipped with the Atomic
Host image, we faced the problem of how to containerize services that are needed before Docker itself

use different technologies such as OSTree for the storage, Skopeo to pull images
from a registry, runC to run the containers and systemd to manage their life cycle.
