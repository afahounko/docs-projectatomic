link:https://github.com/projectatomic/atomic-system-containers[System images] are
Docker images with a few extra files that are exported as part of the image itself,
under the directory `/exports`. In other words, an existing `Dockerfile` can be
converted adding the configuration files needed to run it as a system container
(which translate to an additional `ADD [files] /exports` directive in the `Dockerfile`).

These files are:

* config.json.template - template for the OCI configuration file that will be used
to launch the runC container.
* manifest.json - used to define default values for configuration variables.
* service.template - template unit file for systemD.
* tmpfiles.template - template configuration file for systemd-tmpfiles.

Not all of them are necessary for every image.

All the files with a `.template` suffix are preprocessed and every variable in the form
`$VARIABLE` or `${VARIABLE}` is replaced with its value. This allows to define variables
that are set at installation time (through the `--set` option) as we saw with the Flannel
example. It is possible to set a default value for these settings using the
`manifest.json` file of the system container image.

If any of these files are missing, atomic will provide a default one. For instance,
if `config.json.template` is not included in the image, the default configuration will
launch the `run.sh` script without any tty.

There are some variables that are always defined by the atomic tool, without the need
for an user to specify them via `--set`. Of those, only `RUN_DIRECTORY` and `STATE_DIRECTORY`
can be overriden with `--set`:

* `DESTDIR` - path where the container is installed on the system.
* `NAME` - name of the container.
* `EXEC_START` - Start directive for the systemD unit file.
* `EXEC_STOP` - Stop directive for the systemD unit file.
* `HOST_UID` - uid of the user installing the container.
* `HOST_GID` - gid of the user installing the container.
* `RUN_DIRECTORY` - run directory. `/run` for system containers.
* `STATE_DIRECTORY` - path to the storage directory. `/var/lib/` for system containers.

Weâ€™re excited about the ability of system containers to greatly improve administration and
infrastructure service delivery for Atomic clusters.
