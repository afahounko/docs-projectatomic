An image must be present in the OSTree system repository before we can use it as a
system container. By using skopeo, the atomic tool can pull an image from different
locations, a registry, the local Docker engine or a tarball, according to how the
image is prefixed:

....
# atomic pull --storage=ostree gscrivano/etcd
Image gscrivano/etcd is being pulled to ostree ...
Pulling layer e4410b03d7db030dba502fef7bfd1dae56a6c48faae63a80fd82450322def2c5

# atomic pull --storage=ostree dockertar:/tmp/etcd.tar
# atomic pull --storage=ostree docker:etcd
....


Each layer in the image is stored as a separate OSTree branch, this takes advantage
of the layered model used by Docker images, since `atomic pull` will download only the
layers that are not already available. All the images are stored into the OSTree
system repository.

Using OSTree as storage has the advantage that if the same file is present in more layers,
it will be stored only once, just like for container image layers. A container is installed
through hardlinks, the storage is shared with the OSTree repository hardlink farm.

`atomic images list` shows the list of the available images:

....
# atomic images list
   REPOSITORY    TAG          IMAGE ID       CREATED            VIRTUAL SIZE   TYPE
   gscrivano/etcd   latest       d7c1702506ff   2016-09-08 16:39                  system
....

`atomic images delete` deletes one tag and `atomic images prune` removes the unused layers:

....
# atomic images delete -f gscrivano/etcd
# atomic images prune
