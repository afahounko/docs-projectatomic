=== Setting up a Cockpit server

A Cockpit server is the machine that is running the cockpit service and exposes the user interface. Depending on the operating system, you need to install the _cockpit_ packages or the _cockpit-ws_ container. You can then open the interface in a browser by typing _localhost:9090_, or use any other machine and type in the IP address of the Cockpit server. Through Cockpit, you can also add more secondary hosts to this primary server. They need to have the cockpit packages installed on them. This document refers to the Cockpit server as the primary server and the added hosts as secondary.

==== Installing Cockpit

*A.* On Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host

1. Run the *cockpit-ws* image. Use this command:
+
....
-bash-4.2# atomic run rhel7/cockpit-ws
....

Afterwards, you can log into Cockpit. Go to xref:opening_the_interface[Opening The Interface]

*B.* On Red Hat Enterprise Linux

1. Once you have Red Hat Enterprise Linux installed and with enabled networking, you need to register the system and enable the Extras and Optional repositories:
+
....
# subscription-manager register --auto-attach --username=<rhnuser> --password=<rhnpasswd>
# subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
# subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
....

1. Allow external connections to port 9090 through the firewall:
+
....
#  firewall-cmd --add-port=9090/tcp
#  firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=9090/tcp
....

1. Install the _cockpit_ packages:
+
....
$ sudo yum install cockpit
....

1. Enable and start the cockpit.socket service:
+
....
$ sudo systemctl enable cockpit.socket
$ sudo systemctl start cockpit.socket
....

==== Opening The Interface

[[opening_the_interface]]

1. Open a web browser and enter the server's IP address with port 9090 in the address bar. If the web browser is on the Cockpit server, open _localhost:9090_ or _hostname:9090_. If you get a security warning by the browser, you will need to add this connection to the security exceptions. Click *Advanced* -> *Add Exception* -> *Confirm Security Exception*. After that, you will see the login screen:

1. Log into the Cockpit interface with the same user name and password that you would use to log into the Atomic system.

==== Changing Expired Passwords

If there is an account on your Atomic system that has an expired password, you can change it from Cockpit. For example, if you have provisioned your system using *cloud-init* to set up an expired password, you will be prompted to change it the first time you log into the system. It can also be used by system administrators who want to make sure the user changes his password on the first login.

When you try to log in with the usual password and that password has expired, Cockpit will prompt you to enter the current password again. Enter your current password and click *Login*.

Choose a new password and click *Login*.

[NOTE]
If you can't log into Cockpit and you are not redirected to the changing password screen, check the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file on the Cockpit Server and make sure the `ChallengeResponseAuthentication` line is set to `yes`. After that, restart `sshd` with the `systemctl restart sshd` command.

==== SSH two-factor authentication with Cockpit

Cockpit now supports two-factor authentication so if you have protected your SSH server with such configuration, the Cockpit login screen will prompt you to enter your password and PIN pair. To set up SSH for two-factor authentication you need two components:

* Your company's authenticator application that provides one-time passwords or PIN numbers. An example application is the `Google Authenticator`, which also has its own PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module).
* A server that validates the PINs from your dongle.

These two components can be built in many different ways depending on the infrastructure of your particular company. When you have these two set up, you will need to do the following things:

1. Enter the following line in the `/etc/pam.d/sshd` file as the last `auth` line:
+
....
auth       required         <your_PAM_module>
....

2. Edit the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file so that the `ChallengeResponseAuthentication` line is set to `yes`.

3. Restart the `sshd` service with the `systemctl restart shhd` command.

When you open Cockpit's interface, and enter your password, you will then be prompted to enter your Verification code:
