link:http://www.projectatomic.io[Project Atomic] aims to build a welcoming and diverse community. 
{product-title} Documentation focuses on convering Docs required for {product-title} introduction 
to how to compose, manage and deploy {product-title} and its various application.


=== Requirements

* link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/#what-is-asciidoc[AsciiDoc] markup language to write Docs.
* link:http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor] that acts as text processor to convert AsciiDoc content to HTML5, DocBook and others.
* link:http://www.asciibinder.org[AsciiBinder] that helps to build, maintain documentation in easier way.


=== Set up Development Environment

....
$ sudo dnf install ansible
$ git clone https://github.com/projectatomic/atomic-host-docs.git
$ cd atomic-host-docs
$ git checkout -b <branch-name>
$ ansible-playbook setup.yml --ask-sudo-pass
....


=== How to Write Doc

{product-title} Documentation uses AsciiDoc markup language. You can have a look at the 
link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference[Reference] for AsciiDoc Syntax.

....
$ mkdir atomic-host-guide/container && touch atomic-host-guide/container/overview.adoc
....

.atomic-host-guide/container/overview.adoc
----
[[container-overview]]

Container contains applications in a way to keep itself isolated from the host system that it runs on and 
container allows developer to package an application with all of it parts, such as libraries and other packages
it needs to run and ship it all as one package.
I love Containers!!!
----

After the Doc is ready, we need to make entry in `_topic_map.yml` file. 
This file tells AsciiBinder which *_topic_* groups and *_topics_* to generate.

._topic_map.yml
----
---
Name: Tools
Dir: atomic-host-guide
Topics:
  - Name: Containers
    Dir: container
    Topics:
    - Name: Overview
      File: overview
----

Now go to the root directory of the repo. The following command will build the Documentation.
....
$ asciibinder
....


=== Verify

A new directory will be created named `_preview`. You will be able to browse Documentation from there that you just build.

This is how it will look like after the Doc is build:
